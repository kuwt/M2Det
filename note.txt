QUESTIONS:
Q. when change image size from arbitrary to 512 x 512?
A. in preproc

Q. how to handle no target box?


Q. Why the offical check pt cost is much lower than mine?


Q. How to verify the result?
A. by demo script

Q. what is the intuitive meaning of score?
A. It is the prediction of network(softmax?)

Q. what is the warning log (Errno 104 connection reset by peer)when switching epoch?
A. pytorch official report that this is a bug and can be ignored

Q. why my dataset has a much lower cost?
A.

Q. WHat is the meaning of variance of anchor box
A. A normalization constant for better machine learning as claimed here 
    https://leimao.github.io/blog/Bounding-Box-Encoding-Decoding/

Q. how the feature map parameter is formed?
A.  Determined by the input_size only and the magic number 6 feature maps

Q. and how the step_pattern is used?
A. I think they are redundant as they can be computed by the size of feature map and input size

network component:
self.base
self.reduce
self.up_reduce
self.softmax
self.Norm
self.leach
self.loc
self.conf
self.sfam_module



Next plan:
tensorboard setup
understand the network component (done)
print anchor box size relative to images (already illustrated in the Anchor info)
print multi level multi scale feature activation map (done)
add validation set for the training script
